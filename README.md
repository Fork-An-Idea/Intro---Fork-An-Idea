# What is Fork an Idea

Everyone has ideas. Some are well developed, some are just starting out. Regardless of their status, they are ideas and until an idea is proven to be incorrect, inefficient or replaced by something else we need to share, analyse, develop and test it. 

Sharing an idea creates a copy of it in the mind of the person or community in which it is shared. 

The Internet allows us to share thoughts and ideas. What if someone, has a great idea and no platform to share it, that idea may never be developped. What if that idea was the solution to a  problem?

Share your Ideas, contribute valuable content to Ideas, Fork an Idea and develop it differently while maintaining it's initial concept. The possibilities are endless when people from around the world work together.

Become the Catalyst.
